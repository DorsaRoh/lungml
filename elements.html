            <h1>What is TumorCast?</h1>
            <p>LungML is an application that allows images of pulmonary chest X-ray's
                to be used to detect if a patient <br>
                has manifestations of lung cancer 
                and/or lung disease using machine learning and computer vision.
                Intended for those who lack adequate access to healthcare, LungML solves
                significant predicaments surrounding such matters, while simultaneously providing
                efficient and accurate medical diagnosis for all.</p>

            <h1>What is Lung Disease and Lung Cancer?</h1>
            <p>Lung disease and lung/bronchial cancer are the leading causes of cancer death
                and respiratory disease. However, the detection of such illnesses can be 
                inefficient, burdening, and shockingly expensive for patients. It is 
                incredibly important that a means of reliable and accessible diagnosis is 
                available to all, regardless of circumstance.
